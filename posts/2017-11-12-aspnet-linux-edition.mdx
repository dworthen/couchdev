[ASP.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/apps/web); When the cross-platform version of the infamous ASP.NET we all love (to hate?) was released I immediately began exploring the process of deploying a .NET web application to a Linux host. After all, I was already running several [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) web applications on a Linux box so why not add a few ASP.NET applications and host all apps under one roof. Plus I had to see it to believe it; a Microsoft web app running in a Linux environment!

In this article, I walk through the process of deploying an ASP.NET application to a Linux environment. The application will run inside a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container within a Ubuntu host. The Docker environment is managed with [Dokku](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/) which makes it possible to kick off builds and deployments with simple git pushes. Dokku will also handle (sub)domain routing by managing [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/); good riddance.

**Update:** The final source code lives [here](https://github.com/dworthen/aspnet-linux-edition/tree/1.0.0).

## Setup

1. [Download and install dotnet](https://dot.net) on your development environment.
2. [Install Dokku on a fresh Ubuntu environment](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/getting-started/installation/).
   - I am using [Linode](https://www.linode.com/) to host a Ubuntu 16.04 LTS environment. Instructions for installing Dokku on Linode can be found [here](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku~v0.6.2/getting-started/install/linode/).
   - Alternatively, use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install-win10) to explore this process on a local machine.
3. [Optional] Point a [FQDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) towards the Ubuntu host. If using Linode, as I am, then check out their [DNS Manager](https://www.linode.com/docs/networking/dns/dns-manager-overview).
   - For this article, I have both derekworthen.com, `<SERVER_ADDRESS>`, and blog-demo-aspnet-linux-environment.derekworthen.com, `<FQDN>`, pointing towards my Dokku configured server. `<APP_NAME>` refers to blog-demo-aspnet-linux-environment.

## App Creation

Since this article is focused on the process of deploying to a Ubuntu host we will stick with creating a bare-bones web application. Visit Microsoft docs for an in-depth guide to [getting started with ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/razor-pages/?tabs=visual-studio).

#### .NET Core CLI

At the time of this writing, I am using .Net CLI tools and SDK version 2.0.2 to create a sample app but any version of .NET Core should work.

**Note:** Run `dotnet --info` to print out the version of dotnet CLI tools and SDK installed.

```shell
mkdir <APP_NAME> && cd <APP_NAME> && dotnet new razor
```

Verify the app builds and runs with `dotnet restore && dotnet run`. Head over to localhost:5000 for a front row viewing of the out-of-the-box ASP.NET template in all its glory.

## App Management with Dokku

Shell into the Ubuntu host as the dokku user account created during the setup process. I am using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install-win10) to drop into Bash and connect to the server instead of using an application like [Putty](http://www.putty.org/). Mac and Linux users can ignore the `bash -c` part of the command and delete the quotes surrounding the `ssh` command.

```shell
bash -c "ssh dokku@<SERVER_ADDRESS>"
```

#### Dokku

```shell
# Linux host
$ dokku apps:create <APP_NAME>
```

This will create a git repo at `<SERVER_ADDRESS>:<APP_NAME>`, e.g., derekworthen\.com:blog-demo-aspnet-linux-environment in my case. Dokku will also register a reverse proxy routing with nginx using the `<APP_NAME>` as the subdomain to create the app's `<FQDN>`, e.g., blog-demo-aspnet-linux-environment.derekworthen.com. By default, Dokku will configure nginix to route all traffic on port 80 and 443 (if SSL is enabled) that matches the `<FQDN>` to port 5000 of the app's docker container.

#### Git

On the local machine, initialize git and add a remote location for the newly created dokku repo. (Don't forget to add an [appropriate](https://www.gitignore.io/api/aspnetcore) [.gitignore](https://www.gitignore.io/) file to the project.)

```shell
# Local development machine
git init && git add . && git commit -m "initial commit"
# Must use the dokku user account created during the setup process
git remote add dokku dokku@<SERVER_ADDRESS>:<APP_NAME>
```

Up until now, we have been following the [basic guide for deploying a Dokku app](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/deployment/application-deployment/). We will now follow the instructions for [Dockerfile deployment](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/deployment/methods/dockerfiles/). Dokku will build, run and deploy a docker container based on the provided Dockerfile.

#### Dockerfile; Building and Running ASP.NET Core Applications

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root of the application with the following contents.

```docker
# Stage 1. Building.
# May need use a different tag to get the build to work.
# https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore-build/
FROM microsoft/aspnetcore-build:2.0.2
WORKDIR /source

# caches restore result by copying csproj file separately
# copies project files into the /source/ of the container.
COPY *.csproj .

# Restore dotnet dependencies
RUN dotnet restore

# copies the rest of your code into /source/
COPY . .

# microsoft/aspnetcore-build image contains Node
# so may also run npm install
# or other npm related scripts.
# RUN npm install
# RUN npm run build

# Builds to /out in the root of the container
RUN dotnet publish --output /out/ --configuration Release

# Set environment variables for container
# Dokku maps external port 80 to internal port 5000 and
# the following lines tells ASP.NET to listen on port 5000
# May also omit the following line and add EXPOSE 80
# This will tell dokku to setup port mapping 80:80 instead 80:5000
# and omitting this environment variable will also tell ASP.NET Core
# to listen on port 80
ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS http://*:5000
# EXPOSE 80

# Stage 2. Running the application
WORKDIR /out
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "<APP_NAME>.dll"]
```

The above Dockerfile provides a runtime environment along with tools to build from source code. In a future article, I will cover deploying to a Dokku configured server using a CI/CD pipeline where the build artifacts are created prior to the Docker image. In such scenario, the Docker container does not need build tools and can be imaged from `microsoft/aspnetcore` for the runtime environment.

#### Deploy

It is finally time to push the project to the hosting server with git and watch Dokku build and run the application!

```shell
git add Dockerfile && git commit -m "Add Dockerfile"
git push dokku master
```

If all goes well, Dokku will build and deploy a docker container housing our beautiful ASP.NET application and expose it to the world at the configured `<FQDN>`, e.g., http://blog-demo-aspnet-linux-environment.derekworthen.com/.

## Conclusion

Using Dokku as a simple [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service), we managed to deploy an ASP.NET Core web application to a Ubuntu server bundled as a Docker container. Now that the app creation and configuration is out of the way, changes pushed to the dokku remote location will rebuild and redeploy the application.

## Bonus; SSL Encryption

With the [Lets Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) [Dokku plugin](https://github.com/dokku/dokku-letsencrypt), this could not be easier.

#### Install

```shell
# Need to be logged in as a sudo user instead of the dokku user account
$ sudo dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-letsencrypt.git
```

#### Configure

```shell
$ dokku config:set --no-restart <APP_NAME> DOKKU_LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=<EMAIL>
```

#### Enable

```shell
$ dokku letsencrypt <APP_NAME>
```

#### Auto-renew

```shell
$ dokku letsencrypt:cron-job --add
```

#### Verify

```shell
$ dokku proxy:report <APP_NAME>
```

Look for a https:443:5000 port mapping in the output.

#### Test

Open your favorite web browser and navigate to the https (or http as it should redirect to https) version of your site.
